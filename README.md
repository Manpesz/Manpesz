## 🛩️ Current Project – Manpesz Narrow Body

This project aims to create a **simplified, cost-effective alternative to the Airbus A320/A220**, similar to recent developments by Chinese manufacturers, focusing on:

- Lightweight yet robust airframe optimized for low-cost manufacturing
- Modern glass cockpit with side-stick controls
- Efficient and maintainable fly-by-wire systems
- Optimized for regional routes with seating for approximately 150 passengers

📁 The repositories may include:
- Concept documentation (.md)
- 3D renders and CAD models (.png / .blend / .fbx)
- Control system code and flight simulations (.ino / .py)
- Development diaries and planning documents (.md)
